**Inner Join between PRODUCT and CUSTOMER_ORDER:
SELECT p.Product_ID, p.Prod_Name, o.Customer_ID, o.Quantity
FROM PRODUCT p INNER JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER o 
ON (p.Product_ID = o.Product_ID);

The INNER JOIN clause combines the rows from both tables that have matching Product_ID values. 
This means that the query will return rows that contain information about products and customer orders that have the same Product_ID value.


**Left Outer Join between EMPLOYEE and BOOKINGS:
SELECT e.Emp_ID, e.Emp_Fname, b.Bookings_ID, b.Table_Num
FROM EMPLOYEE e LEFT JOIN BOOKINGS b 
ON (e.Emp_ID = b.Emp_ID);

 query retrieves information from the EMPLOYEE and BOOKINGS tables using a left join based on their shared column, Emp_ID.
 This query combines employee and booking information and retrieves it in a single result set, including information from both tables based on the matching Emp_ID values.

**Right Outer Join between SUPPLIER and PRODUCT_SUPPLIED:
SELECT s.Supplier_ID, s.Supplier_Name, ps.Product_ID, ps.Quantity
FROM SUPPLIER s RIGHT JOIN PRODUCT_SUPPLIED ps 
ON (s.Supplier_ID = ps.Supplier_ID);

The query retrieves the Supplier_ID, Supplier_Name, Product_ID, and Quantity columns from the SUPPLIER and PRODUCT_SUPPLIED tables. 
It employs a right join to include all rows from the PRODUCT_SUPPLIED table, regardless of whether there are matching rows in the SUPPLIER table. 
The result is a combined result set containing data from both tables.
